During web development, I used FastAPI for leverage a Python backend, and if Python wasn't necessary, I created a Node.js backend with either Express or from scratch. My frontend was either pure HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, React/React Native, or Flutter. (I've also dabbled in a handful of other frameworks.)

In both of these startups, I worked on developing AI tools! My work at AGI House had a full-stack focus with me developing the backend for their events webpage along with internal AI-tools.

Specifically, I've grown more familiar with practical skills, like more familiarity with how to work with memory in C and debugging with gdb, and learned more about the inner workings of Linux. The class primarily consisted of adding specific features to xv6, a bare-bones operating system. Throughout the class, I think I've managed to touch every file in xv6 and really get familiar with how an OS works which is what I primarily wanted to get out of the class. My aspiration is to build my own operation system someday, though now I think I have a much better idea of how many components would go into that!</p>"},{"location":"class_projects/#copy-on-write","title":"Copy-on-Write","text":"<p>An oddly finnicky aspect to add. The key idea of copy-on-write is that when creating a fork, often we don't need all of the memory, especially since we often have a fork() followed by an exec() which will override all the files anyways. Instead, we can lazily allocate physical memory as needed. Some key components that went into the lab was (1) moving around the allocation logic, (2) keeping track of how many things were pointing to a VA to decide when to free it, and (3) making sure all other errors still returned. </p>"},{"location":"class_projects/#61010-fundamentals-of-programming","title":"6.1010: Fundamentals of Programming","text":"<p>Overall, this class was pretty chill with labs usually taking me the afternoon to complete.
