I'm Shreya Chaudhary","text":"<p>This website is currently under development!</p> <p>Expect for some major changes to occur within the new few hours and days!</p> <p>Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Engineering at MIT. I'm currently exploring the vast awesomeness of computer science and engineering and trying to find what vibes with me best!</p> <p>This website's very much a work-in-progress, but here are some things to know about me!</p> My Developer Environment <p>Text Editor: Right now, my primary text editor is Vim. (I've dabbled in NeoVim but haven't yet switched over.) I have a pretty minimalist setup but have just about everything I need!</p> <p>Operating System: The operating systems I use most are Ubuntu and MacOS. Some other operating systems I occassionally use are Kali and Mint. (I'm also taking an OS class right now and working on implementing aspects of xv6!)  </p> My Stack <p>Primary Programming Language: I've found myself using a lot of Python recently for all the machine learning and data science work I've been doing. I've also been pretty interested in more low-level work and have consequently been finding myself using a lot of C and C++. </p> <p>Data Science Stack: I tend to use a lot of Python, R, and occassionally Julia and MATLAB. I use a ton of PyTorch and ocassionally Tensorflow.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data Visualization: Data visualization is super important for presenting your work, and I've explored several different libraries. For R, I primarily use ggplot2. In Python, for simple plots, I use Matplotlib or Plotly; for dashboards, I use Plotly Dash or Streamlit. </p> </li> <li> <p>Graph Technology: I've been working with graphs since mid-high school. I worked for TigerGraph for two years and used it for side projects. For graph machine learning, I primarily use Pytorch-Geometric and occassionally DGL. </p> </li> <li> <p>Natural Language Processing: I like spaCy's models a lot. I also have used NLTK for more traditional NLP work.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Web Dev Stack: I used to work on a ton of web development and now only occassionally help out with web dev projects. During web development, I used FastAPI for leverage a Python backend, and if Python wasn't necessary, I created a Node.js backend with either Express or from scratch. My frontend was either pure HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, React/React Native, or Flutter. (I've also dabbled in a handful of other frameworks.) For the database, I used MongoDB, Firebase, and TigerGraph.</p>"},{"location":"classes/","title":"My Current Coursework!","text":""},{"location":"classes/#freshman-year","title":"Freshman Year","text":""},{"location":"classes/#fall","title":"Fall","text":"<ul> <li>Math for Computer Science</li> <li>Introduction to C and Assembly</li> <li>Multivariate Calculus</li> <li>Physics I: Mechanics</li> <li>Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry</li> </ul>"},{"location":"classes/#iap","title":"IAP","text":"<ul> <li>MASLab</li> <li>Weblab</li> <li>Introduction to Quantum Computing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"classes/#spring","title":"Spring","text":"<ul> <li>Computational Structures</li> <li>Introduction to Probability</li> <li>Introduction to Algorithms</li> <li>Circuits</li> <li>Introduction to Media Studies</li> </ul>"},{"location":"classes/#sophomore-year","title":"Sophomore Year","text":""},{"location":"classes/#fall_1","title":"Fall","text":"<ul> <li>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li> <li>Operating Systems Engineering</li> <li>Robotics Manipulation</li> <li>Introduction to Machine Learning</li> <li>Fundamentals of Programming</li> <li>Screenwriting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects (and Skills)","text":"<p>There are a ton of things I'm interested in and I'm still exploring!

I even had a publication reach out to translate my article! Check it out to see a ton of my older projects! You'll notably find a ton of TigerGraph projects I worked on! Here are some pictures from those projects!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/#technical-projects","title":"Technical Projects","text":"Modelling 1000+ Satellites with GMAT <p>Over the summer, I got to learn how to conduct orbit modelling and wrote a Python program to generate a script to feed into NASA's GMAT to simulate over 1,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). This is simulating a Walker Constellation.</p> <p></p> A Suite of Differential Privacy Algorithms <p>During IAP 2023, I helped develop a suite of differential privacy algorithms specifically for energy-related use cases. I used the Laplace Mechanism to add sufficient noise to both continuous and discrete data. Here's a gif of the algorithm in action, generating a synthetic dataset on some arbitrary distribution I created. You'll notice that at the beginning, the data is completely different from the original dataset; however, over time, it converges to roughly the ideal dataset with a certain amount of noise.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/#libraries","title":"Libraries","text":"TorchQuantum <p>I've helped out with expanding and maintaining TorchQuantum, a GPU-accelerated PyTorch-based framework for quantum computing and simulation. I've worked on streamlining the review process for new PRs, solidifying the structure of the framework, and added several new gates. I also penned a new tutorial.</p> <p></p> TigerGraph.js <p>I developed a Node.js connector to ease the process for full-stack developers to use TigerGraph. (This project also managed to win 3rd place overall at the Graphathon challenge!) </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/#fun-generative-projects","title":"Fun Generative Projects","text":"A DCGAN Birthday Card <p>For a friend's birthday, I used Selenium to scrape a ton of birthday card images and trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network to make a birthday card.
