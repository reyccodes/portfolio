# C/C++

```
This page is currently under development!

Expect for some major changes to occur within the new few hours and days!
```

I often get asked about C/C++ experience, so I created a page for it! You'll also see some Rust around here!

## Experiences

???+ note "Robot Locomotion Lab"

    I used the C++ Drake library to allow Spot to navigate through voxels. 

???+ note "Model-Based Embedded Robotics Lab"

    I heavily debugged and interacted with the C++ backend for Crazyflies to get the demonstration up. I also developed some visualizations in C++.

???+ note "Compilers at MIT"

    I developed some helper tools in C++.

???+ note "Artephi Computing Inc."
    
    I developed a beta C++ API of our algorithms to try out some intense performance engineering!

## Projects

???+ note "Accelerated Computing Projects"
    We exclusively used C++ and CUDA C++ accelerated computing! Some projects include:

    - Matrix Multiplication
    - Mandelbrot Simulation
    - Wave Simulation

???+ note "Performance Engineering Projects"
    We exclusively used C in performance engineering to make code as fast as possible! Some projects include:

    - (Simplified) Chess Bot
    - Multi-Body Graphics Simulation
    - Garbage Collector
    - Matrix Operations

???+ note "OS Engineering Projects"
    I also exclusively used C for operating systems engineering where I implemented a ton of features for xv86.

???+ note "JankTerm"
    I created a custom terminal emulator in C called JankTerm with Vim keybindings, custom rendering, and a custom theme!

???+ note "RecoveryCLI"
    Made a silly little CLI to manage my recovery codes in C++.

???+ note "Search-and-Rescue"
    I created distributed, online multi-drone search-and-rescue demonstrations on Crazyflie hardware! This heavily involved C++ to connect to the Crazyflie backend.
