# Hi! I'm Shreya Chaudhary

### Welcome to my GitHub! 

#### Mini Intro

Hello there! Around here, I go by `sudo` (which is `01110011011101010110010001101111` in binary!) Here you'll find my trove of projects! 

I'm still exploring my interests, but I find particular joy in high-performance computing and low-level programming!

> **I am currently in the job market, seeking full-time positions in software engineering. If you think I could be a good fit, please [reach out](#contact)!**

#### Projects

My most recent open-source project is maintaining [torchquantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum)â€”feel free to reach out with any questions about the library! I also work on several other projects which aren't open-source (yet!) Check out below for a snapshot of some open-source projects I'm particularly proud of!

##### Custom-Made Tools I Regularly Use

Someday I'd like all my tools to be custom-made! For now though, here's my growing list of custom-built tools I regularly use!

!!! warning "This website is currently under development!"
    Expect for some major changes to occur within the new few hours and days!

Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Engineering at MIT. I'm interested in developing performant systems!

This website's very much a work-in-progress, but here are some things to know about me!

???+ note "My Developer Environment"

    **Text Editor**: Right now, my primary text editor is Vim. Been exploring Emacs, maybe I'll switch over... 

    **Operating System**: My primary operating system is Ubuntu! 

???+ note "My Stack"

    **Primary Programming Language**: I primarily work in C, C++, and Python. Recently, I've been using a lot of Rust.

    **Data Science Stack**: I tend to use a lot of Python, R, and occassionally Julia and MATLAB. I use a ton of PyTorch and ocassionally Tensorflow.

    - **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is super important for presenting your work, and I've explored several different libraries. For R, I primarily use ggplot2. In Python, for simple plots, I use Matplotlib or Plotly; for dashboards, I use Plotly Dash or Streamlit. 

    - **Graph Technology**: I've been working with graphs since high school. I worked for TigerGraph for two years and used it for side projects. For graph machine learning, I primarily use Pytorch-Geometric and occassionally DGL. 

    - **Natural Language Processing**: I like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)'s models a lot. I also have used [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for more traditional NLP work.

    **Web Dev Stack**: I used to work on a ton of web development and now only occassionally help out with web dev projects. During web development, I used FastAPI for leverage a Python backend, and if Python wasn't necessary, I created a Node.js backend with either Express or from scratch. My frontend was either pure HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, React/React Native, or Flutter. (I've also dabbled in a handful of other frameworks.) For the database, I used MongoDB, Firebase, and TigerGraph.
