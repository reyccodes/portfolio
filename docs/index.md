# Hi! I'm Shreya Chaudhary

!!! warning "This website is currently under development!"
    Expect for some major changes to occur within the new few hours and days!

Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Engineering at MIT. I'm currently exploring the vast awesomeness of computer science and engineering and trying to find what vibes with me best!

This website's very much a work-in-progress, but here are some things to know about me!

???+ note "My Developer Environment"

    **Text Editor**: Right now, my primary text editor is Vim. (I've dabbled in NeoVim but haven't yet switched over.) I have a pretty minimalist setup but have just about everything I need!

    **Operating System**: The operating systems I use most are Ubuntu and MacOS. Some other operating systems I occassionally use are Kali and Mint. (I'm also taking an OS class right now and working on implementing aspects of xv6!)  

???+ note "My Stack"

    **Primary Programming Language**: I've found myself using a lot of Python recently for all the machine learning and data science work I've been doing. I've also been pretty interested in more low-level work and have consequently been finding myself using a lot of C and C++. 

    **Data Science Stack**: I tend to use a lot of Python, R, and occassionally Julia and MATLAB. I use a ton of PyTorch and ocassionally Tensorflow.

    - **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is super important for presenting your work, and I've explored several different libraries. For R, I primarily use ggplot2. In Python, for simple plots, I use Matplotlib or Plotly; for dashboards, I use Plotly Dash or Streamlit. 

    - **Graph Technology**: I've been working with graphs since high school. I worked for TigerGraph for two years and used it for side projects. For graph machine learning, I primarily use Pytorch-Geometric and occassionally DGL. 

    - **Natural Language Processing**: I like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)'s models a lot. I also have used [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for more traditional NLP work.

    **Web Dev Stack**: I used to work on a ton of web development and now only occassionally help out with web dev projects. During web development, I used FastAPI for leverage a Python backend, and if Python wasn't necessary, I created a Node.js backend with either Express or from scratch. My frontend was either pure HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, React/React Native, or Flutter. (I've also dabbled in a handful of other frameworks.) For the database, I used MongoDB, Firebase, and TigerGraph.
