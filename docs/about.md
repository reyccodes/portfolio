Hello there! I'm Shreya, a master's student at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering! I'm still exploring my interests, but I find particular joy in high-performance computing!

Below is roughly what you should know about me! You can also check out the tabs to get a thorough runthrough of my interests and work. I would say my primary interests are in performance/systems and machine learning (specifically the intersection of the two!)

### Projects

My most recent open-source project is maintaining [torchquantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum)â€”feel free to reach out with any questions about the library! I also work on several other projects which aren't open-source (yet!) Check out below for a snapshot of some open-source projects I'm particularly proud of!

### Other Things About Me! 

???+ note "My Developer Environment"

    **Operating System**: My primary operating system is Ubuntu! 

???+ note "My Stack"

    **Primary Programming Language**: I primarily work in C, C++, and Python. Recently, I've been using a lot of Rust.

    **Data Science Stack**: I tend to use a lot of Python, R, and occassionally Julia and MATLAB. I use a ton of PyTorch and ocassionally Tensorflow.

    - **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is super important for presenting your work, and I've explored several different libraries. For R, I primarily use ggplot2. In Python, for simple plots, I use Matplotlib or Plotly; for dashboards, I use Plotly Dash or Streamlit. 

    - **Graph Technology**: I've been working with graphs since high school. I worked for TigerGraph for two years and used it for side projects. For graph machine learning, I primarily use Pytorch-Geometric and occassionally DGL. 

    - **Natural Language Processing**: I like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)'s models a lot. I also have used [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for more traditional NLP work.

    **Web Dev Stack**: I used to work on a ton of web development and now only occassionally help out with web dev projects. During web development, I used FastAPI for leverage a Python backend, and if Python wasn't necessary, I created a Node.js backend with either Express or from scratch. My frontend was either pure HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, React/React Native, or Flutter. (I've also dabbled in a handful of other frameworks.) For the database, I used MongoDB, Firebase, and TigerGraph.

### Summary of Experience

I previously worked on Artephi Computing where I worked on benchmarking and profiling our quantum-inspired optimization algorithms written in Jax. My work both expanded the codebase and identified and addressed bottlenecks (which led to a 10x speedup across some benchmarks!)

In addition, I have worked at AGI House and Infinirate. In both of these startups, I worked on developing AI tools! My work at AGI House had a full-stack focus with me developing the backend for their events webpage along with internal AI-tools. In that internship, I learned how to deploy AI applications with a focus on accuracy and performance. My work at Infinirate had a systems focus where I rapidly developed many AI prototypes and infrastructure.

Before these, I worked at TigerGraph where I created developer tools for the community.

Another super important aspect of my life was all the work I've done in academia! I was the core developer of TorchQuantum (now with over 1,500 stars!) and I worked to productionize the library. I've also worked on bioinformatics machine learning models, satellite modelling, and so much more! Check out the projects above and the tabs to get a taste of my work! I eventually found that I really enjoy algorithm engineering and working on high-performance computing tasks.

I'm currently seeking roles in software engineering! I hope that the work I do can reach people!
