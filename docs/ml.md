I've been working on AI and ML since 2018 and programmed my first neural network from scratch in middle school! I have a number of research and industry experiences in AI/ML. I'm specifically very interested in **efficient ML** and looking at low-level software and hardware optimizations.

## Experiences

???+ note "Model-Based Embedded Robotics (2025)"

    I created search-and-rescue multi-drone demonstrations! This used MAPF (with reinforcement learning) to plan drone trajectories. 

???+ note "Infinirate (2025)"

    I worked on rapidly developing AI prototypes and developing AI infrastructure! The startup is still in the stealth phase.

???+ note "Bioinformatics Lab (2022-2025)"
    
    I worked on using and creating foundation models for predicting the functionality of ncexons.

???+ note "AGI House (2024)"

    I worked on building efficient and accurate AI and ML algorithms and pipelines for internal stealth startups with a focus on RAG and CV, collaborating with startup founders in the area. 
    My primary projects included building a performant search combining RAG and query search. I worked closely with building agentic AI frameworks! 
    
    From this experience, I learned how to **ship accurate and performant AI applications**!

???+ note "Multimodal AI Lab (2024)"
    
    I worked on experiments to learn about different modality interact with each other to have a richer understanding of multimodal AI!

???+ note "TigerGraph (2020-2022)"

    At TigerGraph, I worked on a number of cool projects involving NLP and knowledge graphs!  

## Projects

???+ note "Core Developer of TorchQuantum [1.5k+ stars]"
    I've worked on expanding and maintaining [TorchQuantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum), a GPU-accelerated PyTorch-based framework for quantum computing and simulation. I've worked on streamlining the review process for new PRs, solidifying the structure of the framework, and added several new gates. I also penned a [new tutorial](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum/tree/main/examples/qubit_rotation).

???+ note "OrderBot"
    For 6.421, I built a robot that could prepare foods from a human order given a list of random ingredients from a known set of ingredients.
