Robotics is a super fascinating field to me, both for the algorithmic rigor and the awesomeness of seeing your code work on hardware! Below are some neat projects I've gotten to work on!

## Experiences

???+ note "Robot Locomotion Lab"

    I worked on porting high-resolution robocasa kitchen environments into Drake, specifically with an interest of running Spot in the environments.

???+ note "Model-Based Embedded Robotics Lab"

    I worked on distributed and online algorithms for multi-drone search-and-rescue tasks!

???+ note "Haystack Observatory"

    I worked on modelling megaconstellations with GMAT.

## Projects

???+ note "Modelling 1000+ Satellites with GMAT"
    Over the summer, I got to learn how to conduct orbit modelling and wrote a Python program to generate a script to feed into NASA's GMAT to simulate over 1,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). This is simulating a Walker Constellation.

???+ note "OrderBot"
    For 6.421, I built a robot that could prepare foods from a human order given a list of random ingredients from a known set of ingredients.

???+ note "Robocasa in Drake"
    I created a script to port RoboCasa kitchen environments into Drake's meshcat!

???+ note "Search-and-Rescue"
    I created distributed, online multi-drone search-and-rescue demonstrations on Crazyflie hardware!
