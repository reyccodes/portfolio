# Performance and Systems!

!!! warning "This page is currently under development!"
    Expect for some major changes to occur within the new few hours and days!

Junior year, I took performance engineering (6.106) and it was one of the coolest classes I've ever taken! Since then, I've fallen head-on in the performance engineering and systems hole. 

## Experiences

???+ note "Compilers @ MIT"

    I started working on sparse tensor compiler (Finch)! I worked on adding some features to the compiler such as new algorithms and internal functions.

    I'm now working on building infrastructure to build high-performance domain-specific languages in Python!


???+ note "Artephi Computing Inc."

    I worked on developing performant quantum-inspired algorithms in Jax! In total, I managed to get a 10x speedup on some of our benchmarks!


## Projects

???+ note "Finch.jl"

    I added some features like a sparse depth-first search and degree centrality and added features like argmin, argmax, and dropdims.

???+ note "FS"
    
    For my distributed final project, we did an exploration of different file systems, with our final file system with RDMA support (using Soft iWARP).

???+ note "TinySAM"
    
    For my TinyML final project, we benchmarked many segment-any models (SAM) and created quantized SAM models
